* GO Experiments

The purpose of this repo is to be testing ground and sandbox for ideas
that have an extremely short lifespan. Think pipeline or concept
demos, or something temporarily needed for a demonstration at a meeting.

Individual experimental projects live in subdirectories and should be
self-contained (unless that is part of the test).

** widget

   This is an experiment in using a gulp, npm, and other tools in
   creating and distributing a self-contained JavaScript widget that
   can be consumed by third-parties.
